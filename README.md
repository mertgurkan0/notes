*this is a place where I list notes for myself & stuff that I want to learn/check out*

### **5/10/20**

as side projects to my thesis work, I currently plan to;
  - Check out WoW Addon programming with Lua and develop a simple ingame notebook addon
  - Check out [Magenta](https://github.com/magenta/magenta) and play with ML (if possible GANs) stuff
